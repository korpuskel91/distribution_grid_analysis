# Data-driven Distributionally Robust Optimal Power Flow for Distribution Systems
Repository containing supplementary data and code for the paper "*Data-driven Distributionally Robust Optimal Power Flow for Distribution Systems*" by Robert Mieth and Yury Dvorkin.
If you use this code or its for academic purposes please cite this paper. 


The optimization model was implemented by using [JuMP](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl) (Version 0.16) and auxiliary packages in the [Julia](http://julialang.org/downloads/) (Version 0.6) programming language. 


Additionally, we used Gurobi Solver in our numerical experiments. [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com) is a commercial solver which must be installed and licensed (e.g. using an academic license).
